;BACKGROUND BUFFER: OneTileNamBuffer
;this buffer format favours standout tile changes
;instead of setting VRAM in game code, prepare a buffer in main RAM (for example, use unused parts of the stack at $0100-$019F) before vblank
;and then copy from that buffer into VRAM during vblank
;it's important that as much of the computation is moved out of NMI as possible, the address is an address, not an x and y value
	.rsset $0100

	;first byte: tells how many elements there are to copy over (this means one element is 3 bytes), if 0, no bytes will be read (if namBuffer is 4 then there are 4 elements in the buffer)
	;rest of buffer, three bytes are read for each change in background; 0: tile index, 2: low-byte, 1: high-byte, this is because it is read backwards
